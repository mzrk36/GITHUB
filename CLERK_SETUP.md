# Clerk Authentication Setup

## Overview
Clerk authentication has been successfully integrated into your JobSpot Connect application.

## What's Been Added

### 1. **Clerk Provider Setup**
- Added `ClerkProvider` wrapper in `src/main.tsx`
- Configured to use `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from environment variables

### 2. **Authentication Components**
- **Navbar Integration**: Sign In/Sign Up buttons for unauthenticated users, UserButton for authenticated users
- **AuthPage**: Dedicated authentication page at `/auth` with SignIn and SignUp components
- **ProtectedRoute**: Component to protect routes that require authentication
- **Dashboard**: Example protected page showing user information

### 3. **Routes Added**
- `/auth` - Authentication page with SignIn/SignUp tabs
- `/dashboard` - Protected dashboard page (requires authentication)

### 4. **Navigation Updates**
- Navbar shows different links based on authentication status
- Authenticated users see a "Dashboard" link
- UserButton appears for authenticated users with sign-out functionality

## Environment Setup

Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here
```

## How to Use

### For Unauthenticated Users:
1. Visit any page - you'll see "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons in the navbar
2. Click either button to go to `/auth` page
3. Use the tabs to switch between Sign In and Sign Up

### For Authenticated Users:
1. After signing in, you'll see your user avatar in the navbar
2. Click the avatar to access user menu (profile, sign out, etc.)
3. Navigate to `/dashboard` to see your personalized dashboard
4. The navbar will show additional "Dashboard" link

### Protected Routes:
To protect any route, wrap it with `ProtectedRoute`:
```tsx
<Route 
  path="/protected-page" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <YourProtectedComponent />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```
